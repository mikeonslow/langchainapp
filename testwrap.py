        â€ŠThe seminar today, it, uh, it is a matter of introduction is, um, a collaborative effort with teammate technology. Um, Eric, her is joining us. He's the president of, uh, of teammate technology and the other Eric, can you see here, Eric? Tiffany is the subject matter expert at Teammate Technology. I'm Jason Beck and I'm the head of sales, um, at Crescendo and at Sapiens.

Most everybody on this. Call knows who I am, but not everybody knows who Eric and the, uh, the two Erics are. Uh, so the purpose today is to, is to continue to reinforce the opportunity that selling into a Microsoft Teams environment offers. Um, and we and, and teammate technology has made some huge strides.

Um, in the past month or so to broaden the appeal of the, uh, of the net sapiens platform into the teams community. So that's really the purpose of the, of the session. Uh, we don't have a lot of ground rules. This is a webinar, so if you have questions, what I will do is I will monitor the chat window. Um, so as Eric and Eric are going through this presentation, we'll periodically take a break and we'll review the questions that come up.

So we'll try to answer them, uh, as frequently as possible. Um, So, with that being said, uh, Eric, um, you have before us, sir. Okay. I, I assume you can see my screen? Yes, sir. We can. All right. Uh, well, uh, thank you everyone for, for attending. Uh, happy to see such a large turnout and, uh, I guess we'll just get right into it.

Um, so the, the, the reason for, uh, this webinar in. Uh, specifically is to talk about a new, uh, feature that teammate is launching. Um, there are, many of you I'm sure are familiar with teammate. We've had a very successful partnership with Crescendo Ms. SAPs over the years, and, uh, you know, they're quite a number of you that I see on the, on the.

On the chat panel, uh, that are existing customers, what's the, what's happened though is, is we've come up with a, a new innovation that allows you to, uh, really overcome an obstacle that has, that we've heard, uh, consistently has been an obstacle to actually selling into organizations that use teams. And that is namely the the $8 phone system license.

Uh, that is required to be able to connect Microsoft teams to the direct routing and, and to our connector. Um, and so, uh, that, that new feature, uh, is a, a calling app that largely removes the, the need for that. And we'll talk about that in more specifics. Uh, I'm going to talk about, you know, the, the, what the actual, uh, user experience looks like, and then.

Eric, Tiffany will go through, uh, some of the steps that are needed on the backend in our service portal to be able to configure that. Um, as, as far as I know, and Jason will correct me if I'm wrong, but, uh, everybody who has signed up for the service through Crescendo has access to the, uh, we call it the valet app, uh, today.

And so it's just a matter of going into your, uh, service portal and turning it on and trying it out. So, uh, this first slide, before I get into the details though, uh, would just want to kind of give you a lay of the land to talk about, you know, what the opportunity look and why this is so exciting. So, uh, this first slide, uh, some of you, uh, may have seen this before.

This is, uh, this used the same slide in, in the last, uh, webinar that, that we did with Crescendo, but it's talking about the size of the market. And so, uh, you know, there are 345 million. Uh, paid Microsoft Office subscribers, um, seats, uh, of which 270 million of them are teams. Users actually have the teams client on phones.

So that's really the, the addressable market that you can talk to. And of, of those 270 million, uh, teams, users about 80 million have the phone system license, and that phone system license is. Is what you needed to be able to use the teammate connector in the past, uh, until now. So given that that's no longer required, uh, what we're talking about is an opportunity to sell your services to the 270 million monthly teams, users, uh, that are out there.

So that's, that's quite a large market and, uh, one, we're excited to help you address. So first, uh, just a, a little background, what is Microsoft Phone System? Well, as, as you probably have heard, Microsoft is out there trying to sell their business phone system. Uh, Uh, uh, suite, uh, as a replacement for existing business phone systems.

So, uh, Microsoft would like businesses to ditch their ucas or their PBX or whatever they may happen to be used to talk to, uh, the external world and replace it with Microsoft phone system. And, uh, you know, they've created, uh, a lot of interest and a lot of noise in the market. It's just by virtue of the fact, uh, that they're Microsoft and that there are 270 million teams users out there, and of course, teams.

Is the entry point to their phone system, that is the, the primary endpoint that's used to make and receive phone calls? Well, uh, you know, in order to use Microsoft phone system, uh, you really need, uh, either an, uh, one of the high level licenses with Microsoft, so that's E five G or a five, uh, for educational, uh, institutions.

And if you don't have one of those licenses, if you have anything else, generally. Uh, upcharge from Microsoft to get the phone system license now. Um, You know, as I mentioned, Microsoft is out there making a lot of noise about Microsoft phone system, and they have converted quite a large number of enterprises to phone system.

But when you really think about it, um, what these organizations are generally interested in, Is teams and not necessarily Microsoft phone system as a whole. Um, this is the results of, uh, of a poll that was taken of enterprises that had switched to Microsoft phone system. Uh, and this is the top five reasons for switching and if you'll notice of the reasons given the top three in terms of the number of respondents who, who picked these as their most important, uh, reasons are all features of the team's client itself and not features of.

The phone system as a whole. So, you know, integration with Microsoft products, well that's what you, you get that through the, the team's client, the user experience that is, and by that, uh, I interpret that to mean being able to live inside Microsoft teams and, and. Go about your business on a day-to-day basis without having to use other types of applications.

Having a centralized experience in Microsoft, which includes talking on, uh, on the phone, uh, through, uh, you know, through the pstn to your clients. And then the third, uh, is security and compliance. And so these are all, and by security, the appliance. I take that to mean the ability to. Manage the distribution of applications to your, your workers and to be able to understand what usage looks like.

As we all know, Microsoft has many tools that allow that to happen and, you know, have a fairly mature way of distributing, uh, software through enterprises. So anyway, given that the, the top three features of, uh, that, uh, that are cited for switching to Microsoft phone systems. Are actually features of the team's client and not of the phone system.

Well, well, that's an opportunity, right? Because that means if you can use a teams client to connect your customers or new customers to your UCAST service with net sapiens and crescendo. It's an opportunity because that's really giving the best of both worlds. And the reason it's giving your customers the best of both worlds is because of the great job that Microsoft has done in building the team's client.

You know, when you are able to integrate teams with your existing ucast service, um, you get a lot of benefits as a service provider and your customers get a lot of benefits. Number one, uh, everybody has it with 270 million and growing. Uh, Installations out there, it's not an issue of asking your clients to download, excuse me, some.

A client that they've never heard of. And we all know that that can, can trigger alarms with, uh, it and security personnel about whether the client is secure and, you know, many other things, it's already there, they can just turn it on. Uh, of course, teams is a, is a very capable collaboration suite, uh, with video messaging and, and voice capabilities built in.

Um, the fact that, that Microsoft opened it up and made it available to outside calling systems with direct routing, of course, makes it, uh, a great tool for, uh, an integration with your ucas. Um, of course it integrates with Office 365 and of plethora of other applications. The fact that it's open. Means that many other developers have taken the opportunity to integrate it with it.

And as, as you probably know, there are hundreds and hundreds of applications available within the Microsoft ecosystem that can integrate with teams. But the, the, the, the really interesting parts, uh, for me personally and, and I think for everybody on this call is that Microsoft did a great job of making a soft phone.

They've addressed many of the issues that. That, um, really, you know, uh, uh, uh, make it difficult to deploy soft phones out in the wild, especially on mobile networks. Uh, so from the way they've built their, uh, application to the way that they maintain it, uh, as we all know, when, when, uh, When there are new, uh, operating system versions that come out, uh, they tend to break existing applications and, uh, Microsoft being who they are, they, they cover most of that.

Also in the mobile world, there are a lot of gotchas that you have on mobile networks from, uh, IP six to, uh, mtu size to, uh, multiple nets. To the push notifications that are required to get an inbound call to a, to a application that's running over the top of the mobile network. All of these things, vex service providers, on a day-to-day basis when you are trying to deliver your service.

Through, uh, through an application over the top. Uh, one of the nice things about Microsoft is that they've addressed many of these issues and they just make, uh, an application that really works, particularly in the mobile environment. So being able to take that and leverage it, uh, to extend the reach of your UCAST service is really quite compelling.

So, and, and that's, that's the, that's the opportunity that that teammate was created to address. We created the PBX connector, which has been out in the market now for almost five years, to turn Microsoft teams into a soft phone that can register to your ucas. In addition to that, uh, we've, we've automated a lot of the.

A lot of the complexity that comes in dealing with Microsoft's backend and their direct routing. And typically, if you wanted to set this up, you know, on your own, you would have to get a Microsoft compatible sdc. You would have to, uh, learn PowerShell because all of the commands that are used to enable the direct routing or require PowerShell, you'd have to work with the Microsoft Graph api.

You'd have to do quite a lot just to be able to get the calls in and out. Uh, we've done that, uh, through the teammate PBX connector. And in addition to that, we've uh, integrated it quite nicely with, uh, the crescendo net sapian platform, so that when you're deploying, uh, users, when you're actually out there trying to turn this into a service that people pay for, uh, it's much easier to configure but also maintain and support.

So what what's new though, is what we call the call app. Uh, we also refer to it as valet. And, um, this has been something that's, uh, that's been in development for a while. We've had it in beta, uh, since late February. Uh, I talked about it on my last webinar with Crescendo in March. And, uh, it's really come a long way since then and we're excited to launch it.

Uh, Facility coming up. And what's different about this is that instead of using the entire Microsoft phone system and you know, just to put in perspective, when you pay that $8 for the phone system license, you're really paying for a seat on the Microsoft phone system. And you know, and they have a complete.

Uh, full blown, uh, uh, phone system with, with many PBX capabilities, but you really don't need all of those features to use it as a soft phone. And so Microsoft has made just the client piece available through, uh, what they call Azure Communication Services, uh, Microsoft acs, and that that's kind of their version of C P A S, where you can use just the disaggregated parts of their network to use, uh, to get access to things like the teams client.

So what we did is we took advantage of this, this offering from Microsoft to hook up our PBX connector in a way that does not require you, your customer, rather to pay that $8 phone system license. Now, it's not apples to apples exact the same, exactly the same experience as using the phone, the, the team's client with the phone system license.

But really it's a very comparable experience. Uh, and so, uh, That is, uh, what we'd like to, to, uh, discuss during the rest of this webinar and just a couple dates. Um, so, uh, since we launched this into beta of a few months ago, there were a couple features that were missing from the application. We've been working hard to fill in those gaps.

And our, our release, uh, which will be available on May 22nd to everybody. That's V 2.7 for us. Version 2.7 is our feature, complete version. This is what we believe is, is the product that meets the needs of, of all of you. Uh, and so we intend to run that for roughly a month until June 19th when we have scheduled our, uh, version 2.8 release.

At which point, uh, this app, uh, valet will be, uh, ga in our, in our estimation. Uh, so, so what is it exactly? Oh, I have another, another slide before that just to, to, just to, uh, drive the point home. This slide is meant to show the licensing, uh, from Microsoft, and on the left you have the, the, the Microsoft licensing that you might encounter out in the wild with the customer.

So, uh, at the top you have, uh, just the basic 365 business licenses, basic, standard, and premium, or, uh, an E one or an E three license. Well, uh, with our. Standard PBX connector, you would have to add that $8 Microsoft Team's phone license to it, or your customer would, uh, in order to get the capabilities to connect it to your UCAST service.

Uh, of course if you were had an e, if your customer had an E five, A five or G five license. There's really nothing to add because that comes in with the Microsoft Team's phone system license included, and, and can be, can be connected to your UCAST service without anything else from Microsoft. Um, the change of course with our call app is that for all the licenses, you don't need to add any other Microsoft licensing.

You just add the call app, uh, uh, add on to our PBX connector, and you're automatically able to get the benefits of. Connecting, uh, teams to your, uh, crescendo, ucast service. So, um, As, uh, those of you who know me, uh, may, uh, vouch for I, I typically like to live on the edge and do live demos from time to time I've been known to, to do them.

Unfortunately, that tendency has, has bitten me today because, uh, the, the platform that we're going to do the demo on, uh, is not working quite right. So I cannot do the demo of, of the app in, in practice, uh, in real life. I'm sorry for that, but, uh, but I, I promise you it's there and it works. Uh, so instead what you get is just a screenshot of what it's going to look like.

Um, so this is, this is the valet app dialer, and really when you don't pay for the phone system license, what happens is you don't get the dial pad in Microsoft Teams. You can still call other teams users. The voice capability is there, but it's done through contact. So if you wanted to call somebody else, you would have to select their contact from your list and, uh, you'd be able to call them that way.

Without the dial pad, you can't dial external numbers. So one of the, the challenges we had to open, one of the things we did was to build our own Dialpad. And, uh, if you'll look at the, the left side menu bar, you'll see there's, there's a little icon there that says Vale App. And so instead of having the calls app, uh, you know, which you would typically click on to get access to the Microsoft file iPad, uh, with.

Our solution. Uh, you pin the valet app to that left side menu. You click that and that gives you our Dialpad. Now, a lot of other implementations out there use a similar kind of Dialpad to do what we call cross launch. And what that means is you can dial a number inside the Microsoft Teams client, but what it's really doing is it's connecting to another app that's running on the PC or the Mac, you know, and it's just controlling that client.

And then that client is what is placing the call out through the external UCAS service. Um, it, that's fine for, for what it is, but it's really not giving you all of the great benefits of placing the call through the. Realtime media engine that Microsoft has developed, right? You're not using the team's client, uh, to make the call and you are doing that with our application.

So even though it's a a separate Dialpad, we're still using everything that's inherently inside teams. And so when we launched this a couple months ago, uh, we, we got a lot of feedback and one of the things that we were missing was the ability to do. Hold and transfer. You couldn't place a call and hold and you couldn't transfer a call.

And so those are the features that we've been working to perfect. Uh, and so in our, uh, latest version, uh, and this is the one that, that will be available on May 22nd to, uh, everyone on this webinar. Uh, you now have, uh, active call control. That means that after the call is placed, you're able to control that call, uh, and you'll, you'll, this is what the app looks like.

There's a whole button, there's a transfer button, there's an end call button. And so you'll be able to transfer the call to any of your contacts or to any external PSTN number by dialing in that PSTN number. Uh, so it's really, uh, quite a, quite a big difference. And of course, you know, it's hard to. To offer a service to clients if, if you tell them that some of the basic features that they depend on every day are not part of the service.

So we believe that we've, we've, uh, built a product that meets the needs of your customers, and, and we're really excited to have you try it and, uh, hopefully get success out there in the market. Um, okay. So, uh, with that, that ends my portion of the, uh, presentation. Uh, Eric. Tiffany is now going to, to describe the steps necessary to configure this in the service portal, uh, if you have a teammate account.

And so I think what we're doing is I'll just. Page through the slides. Uh, Eric, can you tell me when you're ready for me to go? So, Eric, if I can interrupt, if I can interrupt real quick? Sure. Lemme just, there was a number of questions about how to enable it, and this might be a good segue for our Netap customers to, so they understand exactly what's involved and then that'll make sense when Eric transitions over.

So, um, If you are currently, um, have a subscription to the teammate application as a Net Sapiens customer, the only thing that we need to do is add the ability to add the valet app onto your existing. Um, we offer two plans for teammate subscription. The, the entry level plan is really $30 a month and includes 10 seats.

Um, and then we have a larger plan which start, which is $2 and 50 cents per seat and scales downwards. Um, so you have to be an existing net sapiens teammate customer to get the valet app. Um, we will go in and simply enable it on your account. So there's no other actions required other than to ask us to do that.

Since it's enabled what you see Eric doing we'll, we'll be there for you to do that. Um, so the, the, the introduction of this service, uh, is very, very easy. There's no real, there's nothing other than to ask us to enable it. Um, one of the questions that did come up, uh, however, which is important, uh, is the question came up.

It says, how does this affect customers who've already purchased the $8 system license so that they can use the the valet app? Um, and so Eric, if you would an, I think I know the answer to that, but I wanna make sure that it's correct. So if, if we did this yesterday. Um, but can you answer that if a customer currently is using the, the phone system license app and wants to get app, what's involved?

So, so one of the nice things about the way, uh, we've deployed this is that you can actually mix and match. You can have some customers, uh, and, and it's common out there that that end users in an enterprise will have different licenses, right? You can have, uh, one, one customer with E five license and another user in the same organization with an E three license or a, you know, teams basic license.

Uh, and so you, uh, For those customers to have E five, you can use the standard PX connector. For the ones that don't, you can use the, the calling app. Um, and if you want to switch, which was the question, uh, it's just a matter of repro provisioning that user inside the teammate service portal, uh, unassign the, the.

And Eric will get into this more when he talks about the provisioning, but, but you're basically unassign the non valet, uh, resource and reassign a, a valet resource. Okay. And then question while we're here. I, I also see, see a question about the, the mobile, uh, whether it works on mobile. And the answer is, uh, absolutely yes.

It works great on mobile. I mean, really one of the best parts about teams is how well it works on mobile, and that extends to, uh, to teammate as well with the, with the calling app. Uh, Uh, you know, you can, you can pin that, uh, valet icon and, and again, it's brandable, it doesn't have to say valet, it can say whatever you want it to say.

You can pin that to the, to the bottom menu in the mobile app and, uh, in place of the regular calling app. And, and you just click that when you wanna make calls and it works the same way. Yep. Perfect.

Okay. Uh, so.  Brandon wants to know if there will be given NFR licenses for testing the, um, I don't think there are any plans to do that at this point, Eric. I mean, if you're the, we've made the teammate licensing cost so inexpensive that most every one of our customers is just subscribe to the 10 user.

Teammate license bundle, which is, which is unique to the crescendo model, by the way. Um, and they've used that for testing, uh, and that, and, and that stack. I, I, I will say though, that, that we, you know, uh, so during the period, since we launched this at the end of February, we haven't been charging anything in, in fact, the billing hasn't even been turned on.

So, uh, you could, between now and, and our GA date, which is in June, uh, turn it on, and, and, uh, you know, Uh, I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, Jason, uh, we're not billing for it, and I don't believe Crescendo is billing for that either if it's just turned on other than the, the standard PBX connector, uh, receipt.

Yes. True statement because we're still, we're still in the, we're still in the beta trial. So once you go to ga that at that point, we view that as being a production environment. And at that point we, um, we would be for, uh, if it is the middle of June, Um, it would be, it would be invoiced in July for a user in June.

But until then, you know, again, early on we've had this with all of our other applications and our other vendors is we want your feedback, we want to collaborate with you. We're not really interested in the $2, we're not gonna extract our $2 from you if you can, if you're willing to do a test for it. So, okay.

So, um, Uh, next question from Mike was, what exactly is a seat? A single user, a single customer? And the answer, Mike, is it's a single user. So a given enterprise is the terminology used for a customer and the users are there. Any number of users within that enterprise, um, would be using the license. Okay.

All right. Um, Almost just on, on that note. Uh, and this may be, may be obvious, but I'll, I'll say it. Uh, so, um, you know, when you, when you, when you're using teams, you could be running teams on your mobile phone, uh, on a number of mobile devices. Your, your, uh, tablet, uh, your laptop. That's all, you know, that's all one team's user, even though Microsoft will deliver the calls to all of them, and, and so that, That is just, uh, one user as far as we're concerned as well for going.

Okay. And, and, and, and one clarification from Robert Riley in his chat. Um, if you have the 10 seat user license, um, those teammate users you can are, are not all necessarily valet users. What. What Eric was saying is if they have an E five G five license there, there is no phone system license. It's part of the the Microsoft package.

If they don't have that license, then they, you would incur that $8 MI phone system license now. You have an option instead of that $8 system license to use the $2 valet app in, its in its place. So the 10 teammate users are 10 teammate users. If they need, if you can, they're incremental and on an elective basis for anyone who needs the valet app on top of the teammate license.

So I hope that's,

All right. Um, let's, so let's, Eric, if that with that is a baseline, I think it'll be a lot, make a lot more sense now when you show people, um, how this actually getting set up. Sure. And again, keep, keep the questions coming. We'll answer 'em in the next break. Sure. So, I, I just wanted to, to give a brief, uh, overview of what the sort of overall flow of setting this thing up is.

Um, it's, if you're familiar with, you know, the initial setup of an enterprise, it's kind of, uh, similar. So when you come into our platform, there's a few things you have to do to begin with to get things set up. And then, uh, after that it's kind of, you know, a repetitive, uh, Set of tasks, you know, to create, you know, additional users.

So the initial steps for this, uh, are a bit different than, than what you may have seen in the past with our other products. Um, so the, their steps that can be taken in parallel. One thing you need to do is to make sure the enterprise has gotten themselves a free. Team's phone license, resource, account license, um, that, uh, that, uh, phone resource account is something people typically have anyway because they may have built, I don't know, auto attendance or, or something else inside, uh, teams.

But, but they're free and they sort of come with, uh, um, you know, by two Microsoft licenses. You probably will get a. 25 free resource accounts, licenses if you want them. Anyway, they need to get those and they need make those available. Um, so that's sort of an initial step before any of this other stuff will work.

Uh, in parallel, the reseller, you know, needs to be able to set up the, at the reseller level, set up their application, the valet app, if you're familiar with the, the PBX app. It's similar, uh, in terms of the way you brand it and, uh, configure it. And then it'll need to be deployed. Uh, to the, uh, enterprise as well where it can be further branded for that particular enterprise.

If, if you so desire, um, the valet service needs to be added to the enterprise and to, if you're a master reseller, needs to be added to your resellers. Um, uh, so there's, there's a couple steps in enabling the service to begin with. Uh, and you know, again, you, you sort of can brand that app template for. The particular enterprise if you want to, or they can just take whatever your, you know, sort of higher level branding is gonna be.

Um, so once you've got that, those steps in place, then the enterprise admin, uh, needs to log in and do a few things, um, uh, create the Valley service instance. Configure, which, which is basically taking advantage of that resource account that they obtained earlier. Um, and then configure that, um, that valet service user to have a sort of, one of your, uh, free available, uh, seats on your, uh, net sapiens platform.

And basically you need to give it a number. Um, Or, or a user rather, um, in, in Sapiens. And then, and then deploy the app, which is the thing that, uh, um, uh, Eric was just showing you with the Dialpad and the, the history and the, um, and the transfer and all those other buttons. Um, and then build users. And so the, the last step is the one that you know, is you just repeat that over and over again.

The first, all the stuff above happens once per customer, per enterprise. Um, but the, uh, um, But building users, you know, the, the customer can go ahead and build those users and they, you build them just exactly like you do with, uh, uh, the regular PBX users that you may have been dealing with already. And, uh, just one point, uh, we also released recently the ability for, uh, our service providers to actually manage a lot of this stuff on behalf of the enterprise.

So if your customer has. Granted that consent, you can actually build those users for them instead of having the enterprise admin having to log in and do syncing. So the, the user building, you know, can happen both for the, at the resettle level and also at the enterprise level. So that's kind of, uh, kind of a nice, uh, a nice, uh, bonus.

Um, anyway, that's the overview. Um, and now we're gonna sort of whip through some, some pictures on what this stuff kind of looks like. So, Um, so as I mentioned, the, the tenant, well the enterprise, but really the tenant in Microsoft needs to go and get themselves at least one resource account. And, you know, just, just as an fyi, it's a challenge to navigate their, uh, their, uh, purchasing, uh, Pages.

Um, so one way to do that is to go into the purchase services in your tenant and click on, you know, the search button, search for resource account. And then you'll probably get those two options down at the bottom. They both say free. I'm not sure that there's any difference between them. And then when you click on details, it'll say buy.

These are challenges that you need to have a purchase, you know, the ability to make that purchase. So even if you, um, Anyway, you've probably done this before, uh, if you've messed around with Microsoft at all, but you do need to actually buy them. They don't just give them away for free. They, you have to buy them for $0.

Um, you buy them, you buy the free license. That's so Microsoft. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Um, uh, anyway. You have to go find 'em and then you have to buy 'em. Um, so once, once you've got that in place, then the reseller can come in and, and add the valet service. Now this is the same similar interface for, um, if you're a master reseller, you would go to your reseller and do basically the same thing.

You go to the right hand side on the action. Uh, click on the three dots, slide down to click on edit Enterprise. We're in the case of a reseller edit. Reseller. And then on that subsequent page, there'll be a section where the services are listed and you'll see, you know, we have a bunch of services, um, and the PBX is there and the new thing is the valet app.

So you just sort of pick valet app off of the list and it pops into that list and you save. And now the valet, uh, service is available for that reseller and or the, the, the enterprise. So that's pretty easy. Um, The other thing, another thing you need to do is to sort of brand your valet app. So once you've got the service available, now when you go to the app, uh template or the app management pages, you'll see that there's another tab.

You know, previously you probably saw a PBX app where you would do your branding, give it, it's new, new, your name, your logos, whatever. Uh, there's now another tab. Um, called valet app, and in there you can do the same kind of branding. In fact, it's almost exactly the same interface. Um, you know, you give it a name, you, you fill out all the other bits and pieces, um, the, the give it the logo and uh, save it.

Um, uh, you know, so, so here, you know, what we're looking at is the enterprise level, uh, app management. Um, uh, previously to that you'll have to set up the template at the reseller level, which will then get inherited by the enterprises. Um, and then when you set it up at the enterprise level, you can do additional branding if you wish, um, you know, for their particular use.

Um, And yeah, just fyi, you, you may have to make sure that you're actually looking at the valet tab, not the PBX tab. Otherwise, you won't actually be building the valet app. Um, so then now that you've got that built, um, and, and set up for the enterprise, and the enterprise guy can come in and has to click on a few things, um, So the first thing that they should see is on their dashboard is there's a button called setup and they should click it.

And when they click it, a bunch of stuff happens in the background to set up that valet service account to, um, provision the right, you know, uh, uh, settings and everything into teams. Um, and it, that this is what depends on the having that, uh, free resource account available. So, um, if you don't have that available, then it's gonna break.

So that's why it's sort of a nice prerequisite for people to make sure that that's, uh, in place. So once you do that, um, and this may take a little while because you know it's Microsoft, um, it, you know, five, 10 minutes is not unreasonable. Um, there'll be a lot of. Stuff going on in the background. And then final, let's say it finished.

Uh, and at that point then, uh, there'll be a different button that pops up saying, uh, configure the Valley service account. So not a service account is created, but now you've gotta configure it and set it up with a number from your, from your, uh, pbx. So this is just exactly like setting up a regular PBX user, uh, that you may have done before.

Via our platform. Um, you know, you click that configure button and then up pops this kind of special, um, uh, configure valet service account. And you'll pick your PBX location, which is probably, you probably have just one of those. Um, you pick your voice route, which, which you may have one or more. Doesn't really matter.

Um, and then you pick your teams user and the teams user, you'll, you'll have exactly one choice and it'll be called Vale Service. Um, and, and so you pick that, then you, you know, assign a phone number, um, um, and, you know, uh, rather a a, a Nets sapiens user. And then, um, uh, set up the, the. I don't know why I put this picture in.

I didn't put them the, uh, the, the one where the, it was, uh, allowing you to pick the user, but in any case, it, you set it up the user just like you would normally. Um, and you can use the user, A D I D or a, uh, just an extension. Okay. So once that user is created, then there's another button that pops up. And so this, this is kind of this long sequence of, of, of doing things in order, uh, in order to get things, uh, configured properly.

So at this point then we need to, the enterprise admin needs to grant consent to do a few things. Um, Uh, it needs to set up, uh, the, these permissions. The permissions will pop up, um, and the, uh, you know, they'll accept that. Um, and then they'll have the opportunity to sync the valet app, um, which is what pushes the valet app out into their, uh, uh, tenant.

Um, so. This is another sequence of things that may take a little while to complete. Um, but with any luck, it will just, you know, go through slick and then you'll be in the point where you can actually set up real users. And this is, this is this part that will be, uh, Something that you as a reseller or the enterprise will do on an ongoing basis.

Um, so, uh, this is just as exactly like setting up a, um, a, a regular PBX user, except that now it's a valet user. So you click on the conf configure valet app user button instead of the ad user button. Configure Vale App user. And you'll get to a page which looks very, very much like the, uh, regular PBX user page.

Um, here in this case, we've actually set it up using, uh, our net sapian integration so that you know, when you pick the pbx, it will populate the SIP user list with the available SIP users. The team's users list will contain only those users who do not have a phone system license. So just the opposite of the way the PBX.

Um, the, the, the, our pre PBX product works, that product requires that you have a phone system license. The valet app requires that you do not have a phone system license. Um, And so only those non phone licensed users will appear in that teams' users list. Um, and, and that is kind of the end of it. I mean, then, uh, and again, as, as I mentioned before, you know, if the reseller has configured, uh, Or the, the enterprises configured that consent grant, then the reseller can come in and create those users, uh, completely souped in us.

Um, there are those steps that I listed though that do need to be cr do need to be performed by the enterprise admin cause there are certain grants and, uh, privileges that are only available when that enterprise admin is logged in and is pushing those buttons. So, Um, so that's kind of, kind of key. Um, so clearly we advise you to, to explore how this works and, and become familiar with it, because as you can see, it is a little bit involved.

But, uh, you know, the, the, the complex part only has to happen once. Okay. Thank you Eric. Uh, that was it. There's a couple just to, to, uh, to reiterate, um, uh, Eric mentioned it, but, but that it was a feature that was, that was included our last release, we call it grant consent. It's really a big deal because, you know, in the past you used to have to be able.

Every time you made a change, uh, to a user, the enterprise admin would have to go in and sync that change because Microsoft wanted the enterprise admin's permission. Uh, since then, uh, Microsoft has allowed, uh, that permission to be delegated and, uh, want, if the Enterprise Global Administrator allows you to, uh, allows you to perform those actions on his behalf by, by clicking the grant consent button, then once that, once the.

App is set up, which, which you cannot grant consent to set up the app, then all of the user management can be done without the Enterprise Global Administrator's, uh, interaction. I think that's a huge, that's a huge advantage. Eric, the grant consent capability, that was, there's a couple questions. The number one complaint, uh, we received about this process, um, I thought the number one complaint was the host of this session, but, That may be a different complaint.

Um, or, or maybe the $8 license. Start with the second one. That would be the second. That would be the second complaint. A couple of good questions though, came up. Um, sms, uh, available using the valet app? I was about to type, yes, but I didn't want to, unless, because I wasn't sure I was hundred percent sure of the answer yes.

In, in that June release. Uh, uh. Uh, 2.8, the existing SMS functionality will be a tab in the, in the valet, uh, interface. Right. And, and for everybody on this call, so you know that there'll be an incremental charge of 50 cents for the use of the SMS app. Um, it's not a, it's not significant, but I just wanted to make sure everybody knew that.

So there you go. There's the answer to that. The answer is yes. Um, can Bella Apps be contact center users? Or contact center agents. I don't know the answer to that. So, yeah, so, so this is the, the, the answer today is no, and the reason is because, um, what happens is if you're on teams, and let's say you're having a, a teams meeting that has nothing to do with the, the pbx.

You know, it's just a teams. There's no, today, there's no way for, uh, us to inform the PBX that you're busy in. So what would happen is, is that, you know, calls would come in even if you're already, if you're already on a call. Uh, we're currently working with the net sapian engineering team, uh, to implement, uh, shared presence so that your presence on teams can be shared with the PBX and, and when that's available then, then it will work with the contact center.

Okay. I, I mean, the way I always pictured this is you've got the E five G, uh, a five G five customers with the phone system license. Those are your, your, um, phone users Today. What this does, what the Vale does is, is it opens it up to a huge swath of. Teams, users who were not licensed for the phone system license.

And that's where the opportunity is with valet is. And one of the questions that came in is, can I mix and match and an enterprise? The answer is yes, of course. Um, but that's, that's where the huge incremental opportunity comes is, is for all those users below that are not, that do not have the phone system license, they have a, a, a much more lower cost op option than they did prior to that.

So, That was, I think the number, the, the biggest complaint that people had is not buying the $8 phone system license and, but having a need for those customers. So, um, okay. So written instructions on the setup in the enterprise admin, um, as it is today that the. State knowledge base, uh, goes through every step.

So you can go to that knowledge base and, and follow that through. Alright, so that was obviously answered, answered, uh, by Eric, so thank you. You got ahead of me a little bit. Um, documentation on setup and pricing. Uh, I reference the pricing. Uh, I'll, I'll reference it again. If you currently have, if you're currently a teams customer on the net sapiens plan, there is no, uh, there is no, um, additional.

Open a ticket and ha. And allow us to, and we'll add the valet app, uh, as a master reseller for you. And then you'll have to go through and configure it the way Eric described it. Um, but there is no additional cost. There is no additional agreement there. It's, it's, um, it's just there for, for the usage. Um, and Caleb, I agree with you.

Shared presence. We got it. We hear, we hear you loud and clear. Um, And Andy, my buddy Andy, has asked the question, um, None of us on this call are concerned, but, you know, but, you know, can you, can, have you ever been able to predict what Microsoft's choosing to do, you know, in the, in the future? Well, well, I, I, I will say it's, it's not so much of a loophole.

You know, we're, we're using the, uh, you know, Azure communication service, which is Microsoft's CPAs, uh, Offering and they've made this, this type of activity, you know, a part of that ACS capability and we're paying for it so that that extra cost is really, you know, that's not profit that goes to pay Microsoft with charges actually per minute for, for the use of teams in this way Now.

Will they continue to do that? Uh, who knows? But, uh, but it's not, you know, it's not like we're taking advantage of, of something that was not, you know, uh, an approved Microsoft use of the, of the service. Microsoft agent Google. So,

okay, so, um, Jr's question on the text here, though. I do think Eric is worth, um, uh, re reiterating the original explanation about the Vale app residing in the teams app, uh, connected to the pbx, um, or connected through the MS Voice infrastructure. You know, the, you know, the backend architecture here.

Um, uh, so, so, um, the, what what's happening here is, is the, the registrations are coming from, uh, we call it the, the. Uh, the teammate connector, it's actually a back to back user agent that knows about all of the teams users and creates registrations for each team's user. So, so our back to back user agent is up in the cloud, it lives in, in Microsoft Azure, and that's what's registering.

To net. Um, but, uh, and just I'm, I'm reading the question. There's no web RTC involved except to the extent that, that Microsoft might use web RTC in the internals of teams. Um, but, uh, it's, it's purely through Microsoft's media engine from the client, uh, all the way to our, our back to back user agent. And then of course, from there to your, to your net sapn server.

All right, perfect. Okay. And, and to raise question again since everybody is clear, um, the teammate user app is the teammate user app that, um, you currently are, uh, under using it the existing sales order. What the valet app does is, is an optional. Add on charge for any of the teammate user apps that want to enable the valet, the, the functionality.

So again, it depends upon whether you need it or not. It's an option onto the, onto the existing app to use the acs, um, connection methodology instead of the phone system PBX license methodology, if that's a better way of stating it. I see a question from, uh, my buddy, Mike McIntosh. Uh, can the transferring be done internally in teams as well as externally?

The answer is yes. So when you go to, uh, transfer a call, you'll be able to select from a dropdown. Well, it's a smart search, so you just start taping in a name or a number. It will show all of your contact, whether those are internal or external, or of course, you can type in just a a pstn number. All right.

All right, so there's a couple quick questions here. Um, uh, I don't know the answer to the current SMS providers allowed their teammates. Do you know the answer to that, Eric or Eric? Yes. Uh, so, um, so today, uh, it's, uh, Twilio, uh, Intelli and Bandwidth. Um, we're currently working on a new carrier called, Tyron, uh, and we're also, uh, we have in the roadmap plans to connect directly to the net sapian core messaging as a carrier so that messages sent through, uh, through the net sapiens platform can also end up inside teams.

Okay. Cool. All right. And, um, conference available soon. That was a question. Um, not sure what, what that means if, if just, uh, Trying to interpret that question. Uh, so, okay. Microsoft does not currently give us a way to join a conference that's kind of like a, a different, uh, a different infrastructure. Um, that, that is something that they say is going to be possible through acs so that you can, uh, for example, provide external phone numbers that ring into a conference, um, a Microsoft meeting, if that's what you mean by conference.

Um, And so, um, you know, we are, we're hopeful that we can, uh, we can use those capabilities from Microsoft in the future, but today, uh, you cannot access, uh, teams meetings externally outside of Microsoft. If you had something else by conference, just just let me know. Okay.

Oh, I see what you're saying. Uh, uh, adding a, uh, okay, that's a good question. So a three-way call is, is what, is that what that question is about? Correct. Um, No, we don't have, we don't have the capability today to make a three-way call from the teams client. Um, not, not to external users, but if you wanted to add an internal teams user to an exist, to a, so when you, when you connect a valet call, you're then effectively, Uh, in kind of a teams meeting, you can then add, uh, other teams users to that call.

Um, so from that standpoint, uh, we've, I've tested that it, that works okay. Um, right, but what, what is not available is the, is sort of calling out to another external number, right? Where used to be trunk to trunk conference call in the old term. Of course, on, on the other hand, if you were to, to add a user from the net sapiens, Uh, end user portal.

Uh, that would work. Of course you could do that. Yep, you could do that as well. Okay. All right, so we're kind of winding down on time and we're kind of winding down on the question. So, um, 15 second warning for any final questions that anybody has. Uh, and if not, I just would like to personally thank both Eric and Eric for going through this.

I, I think it's a huge opportunity pursuing the team's marketplace. I think the work and effort that they've done and that introducing the valet. Functionality, uh, broadens a huge segment of the, of the team's marketplace that might not be normally attractive to this solution. So I think it's a great incremental opportunity, uh, if you know how to take advantage of that opportunity.

So, um, Daniel, last question. Any option for parking calls?

Um, so, so you can, so one of the, one of the capabilities that's currently. Uh, in the PBX app is the ability to program, uh, program over buttons, feature codes, right? So basically transfer. What you're doing when you're parking a call is you're just transferring to a, to a call park orbit on the, on the net platform.

So yes, you can park a call, uh, in that way, I would've thought the answer would be yes. I just didn't know for sure, so I didn't want to stick my neck out, okay? Always plan it safe, Jason.

Not, don't live on the edge. Live close, but not too close. All right. So thank you guys very much appreciate it. Um, if anybody has any questions, um, you know how to reach me, you know how to reach Eric. Um, we're always available to try to help you. Uh, as I said, we're going to be working through in the, in the late stages of the, of the.

This, uh, pre-production release period. Um, and once it's, once it's, um, commercially or generally available, uh, is what I fully expect that, uh, uh, you'll hit the ground running. So, um, so yes. Last question, Caleb. Open it. They're, uh, some of our customers already opened, uh, tickets to enable a valet feature. Um, just enter it in the ticket.

Uh, Terry and I are monitoring it. We'll go in and go through the, all the tickets. We're waiting until this, we had this succession today, and we'll start enabling the valet on your app, uh, as on a as requested basis. So with that, thank you guys very much appreciate it. And, uh, thank you for being part of the, of the net sapiens community and thank you Eric and Eric.

Yeah, thanks. Thanks Jason. Thanks everyone for attending. Have a great day. Take care everyone.
